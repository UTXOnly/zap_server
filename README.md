## Introduction
A [NIP-57](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/57.md) server that allows you recieve zaps on nostr, forwarded to your lightning node running on TOR. This server allows you to create a [Lightning Address](https://github.com/andrerfneves/lightning-address/blob/master/DIY.md) by slecting a username and using a your own domain.

#### Tradeoffs
* You recieve zaps directly to you lightning node
  * You custody your own sats and don't need to worry about sweeping them from a custodial wallet or getting rug pulled by a custodian
* You are creating invoices from your own lightning node and could potentially share information about your node (for example channel balances)
* You must maintain sufficent inbound liquidity to recieve zaps and have some path between the sender's wallet and your node
* You are storing an [invoice.macaroon](https://docs.lightning.engineering/lightning-network-tools/lnd/macaroons#:~:text=invoice.macaroon,write%3B%20onchain%3A%20read) on your zap server which can read and create invoices on your node, protect this!


## How it works?

![zap_server (1)](https://github.com/UTXOnly/zap_server/assets/49233513/2c36d404-97ce-47ae-b9ad-b63bd4de9246)



## Prerequisites 
* An Ubuntu server reachable by a public IP (tested on 22.04 amd64 host server )
* Your own domain
* A Lightning node running [LND](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master)

## What these scripts do
* Installs and configures `nginx` reverse proxy server
  * Uses `certbot` to get TLS certificate for domain
* Deploys Flask server to respond to clients with Lightning invoices

## What you need to do

* Getting your LND REST information and `invoice.macaroon`, this example shows getting this information from a [Raspiblitz](https://github.com/raspiblitz/raspiblitz) node.

* Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/UTXOnly/zap_server.git
```

* Edit the `.env` file to include your node and `LUD-16` identifier using a command line text editor like `nano`.
```
nano .env
```

* Example `.env` file:

```
LND_ONION_ADDRESS="14rgtc4yh2lzl4sdasty4ybnxwwmt6vg75vhrsaypgjmwpbasd423htde.onion" #Repalce with your LND onion address
LND_TOR_PORT=8080 #Replace with your LND REST port (8080 is default you can most likely leave this as-is)
LND_INVOICE_MACAROON_HEX="3FA9F5B7E8D2C4A1F3E5B9A7D6C8E2F0" #The HEX value for your LND invoice macaroon
INTERNET_IDENTIFIER="<YOUR_NAME_OR_NYM_HERE>" ## Add the value on the left side of your LNURL identifier for example if your LNURL identifier is "nabismo@nostpypy.lol" you would add "nabismo" here
HEX_PUBKEY="4503baa127bdfd0b054384dc5ba82cb0e2a8367cbdb0629179f00db1a34caacc"
DOMAIN="<YOUR_DOMAIN>" # Do not include http:// or https:// , For example nostpy.lol
CONTACT=<YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS> # Fr updates about TLC certificate expirt from Certbot
NGINX_FILE_PATH=/etc/nginx/sites-available/default # Dont change this 
```

### Setup the server

* Start the CLI menu
```
python3 menu.py
```

### Using the command line interface (CLI)

* Option 1 runs the server setup script, downloads dependencies, installs and configures the NGINX proxy server
* Option 2 starts the Flask server to begin responding to clients requests for lightning invoices
* Option 3 stops the Flask server (Will not respond to requests for invoices)
* Option 4 exits the CLI menu

## To Do
- [] Update `.env` file permissions, potentially encrypt?
- [] Add UFW firewall rules
- [] Improve error handling
- [] Add unit tests
